                        <p class="card-text">The average person types between 38 and 40 words per minute (WPM). That
                            translates into between 190 and 200 characters per minute (CPM). However, professional
                            typists type a lot faster, averaging between 65 and 75 WPM.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">The CPM stands for the number of characters you type per minute, including
                            all the mistakes. “Corrected” scores count only correctly typed words. WPM is just the
                            corrected CPM divided by five. </p>

                        <p class="card-text">Using AI, we analyzed 1000 most common English books. The AI produced a
                            statistical tree of most connected word chains. The output text is trying to mimic real
                            sentences with the most used word connections, which gives more accurate results. However,
                            it cannot be exactly grammatically correct as it relies on machine learning.</p>

                            how fast you can type gives you enormous productivity boosts. It allows you to make your
                            work done better and higher quality. You will make much fewer type errors, and your work
                            will be much more valuable. You would be able to communicate faster and better.</p>
